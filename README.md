## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
Building the Shrugg Life Continuum â€” a philosophical, narrative, and digital framework to align soul, body, and mind using a 0-1-0 model. Think culture meets consciousness with lemurs, ethics, and myth.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
Salesforce, AI agents, blockchain concepts, and how to turn my chaotic life into a blueprint others can follow. Also deep diving into philosophy, ethics, and metaphysical storytelling.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
Narrative development, digital tools, AI agent logic, simulation theory, app design, weird songs, and worldbuilding grounded in emotional and spiritual growth.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:
Structuring this vision into a working system â€” from writing code and setting up AI agents, to crafting stories that heal, teach, and entertain. Also, making my ideas understandable for people who havenâ€™t lived in my head for 30 years.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
Shrugg Life, the 0-1-0 model, fig theory, the story of Ben Shrugging, escaping the simulation (or at least bending it), and why lighters, lemurs, and legacy all matter.

ðŸ“« How to reach me:
GitHub, fb shathen or shrugg life

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns:
Ben Shruggin / Fig-Eater / Soul-Bodied-Minded (depends what dimension you caught me in)

âš¡ Fun fact:
I once wrote a rap battle between the Devil, a corrupt stockbroker, and a rapper trying to save humanity. I also think a fig contains the secret to the universe
